    "# Exploring SOAP APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the SOAP Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOAP protocol, which means Simple Object Access Protocol, is one of the earliest web service protocols. SOAP is an XML-based protocol and was designed to provide a platform/language-independent way to exchange data between different systems over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **XML-Based Structure:** SOAP messages are structured using XML, making them both human-readable and machine-readable. This structure allows for the encapsulation of data and its transport between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Platform and Language Independence:** One of the core objectives of SOAP is to provide a communication method that is independent of the underlying platform or programming language. This promotes interoperability between diverse systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message Format:** SOAP messages consist of an envelope that defines the message structure and rules for processing, a set of encoding rules for data types, and conventions for representing remote procedure calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transport Neutrality:** SOAP can be used with various transport protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, and more. This flexibility in transport makes it adaptable to different network environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtain and display the capital of the Canada corresponding to the ISO code \"CA\" using the following SOAP API. \n",
    "Step by step guide :\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Examine the XML structure of the SOAP request provided. Identify the tag name that contains the ISO country code and the tag that will return the capital name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Modify the existing SOAP request to use the ISO code \"CA\" isntead of \"FR\". Ensure that the XML structure remains correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Use the modified request to send a request to the SOAP services at the specified URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4:** Analyze the response received. Extract and display the capital name from the SOAP response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5:** Remove sections of code that are not necessary to achieve this objective, in order to simply the script.\n",

    "# REST API Exercise: Star Wars Information Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercice, you will explore the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to retrieve and analyze data related to Star Wars characters, films and planets. The SWAPI API is a RESTful web service that provideinformation about Star Wars universe, accessible through various endpoints.\\\n",
    "This exercice is designed to enhance your understanding of working with RESTful APIs, feel free to ask me if you have any question. Each task will build on the previous one so don't hesitate if you are blocked. Make sure to handle bad response code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the REST Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) conform to the principles of REST, allowing systems to communicate over HTTP in a stateless manner; Some important aspects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resources:** Everything is a resource, identified by a unique URI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HTTP Methods:** CRUD operations are performed using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stateless:** Each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in REST:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Endpoint:** A specific URI representing a resource. Endpoints are URLs that define where resources can be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic HTTP Methods:** One of the core objectives of SOAP is to provide a communication method that is independent of the underlying platform or programming language. This promotes interoperability between diverse systems.\n",
    "    - **GET:** Retrieve data from a specified resource.\n",
    "    - **POST:** Submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "    - **PUT:** Update a resource.\n",
    "    - **DELETE:** Delete a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Request and Response:**\n",
    "    - **Request:** The client's message to the server, including the HTTP method, headers, and optional data.\n",
    "    - **Response:** The server's reply to the client's request, containing status information and, optionally, data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Introduction:** Find some informations about the SWAPI API : the base URL, the Rate limiting and How to auhtenticate. Find information on all available resources withing this API with a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Retrieve Character Information:** Retrieve all characters informations (name, gender, height, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 3: Retrieve Film Information:** Retrieve all films informations (title, director, release date, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 4: Retrieve Planet Information:** Retrieve all planets informations (name, population, climate, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 5: Search and Display:** Create a function to search for and display information about a specific character based on its name. Be sure to handle cases of bad queries and to make at least three unittests with an understandable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 6: Advanced Query:** Store in a pandas dataframe all informations about all the characters of the film you want. Group the characters by species at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 7: Data Analysis:** Create an advanced query to retrieve information on all the films, and find a way to rank them according to the number of characters in the film.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 8 bonus: Additional Endpoint:** Explore an additional endpoint and make a request to display relevant information. For exemple to retrieve starship or vehicles informations.\n",

    "In this exercice you will retrieve the previous results in another way, by consuming the GraphQL API of SWAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Few elements to remember about the GraphQL Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that provides a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs. In this exercise, we will interact with the Star Wars API (SWAPI) using GraphQL to retrieve specific information about characters, films, and species from the Star Wars universe. Some important aspects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Endpoint:** GraphQL APIs typically have a single endpoint for all queries, making it more straightforward to manage and interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible Responses:** Clients receive exactly the data they request, reducing over-fetching of data common in traditional REST APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introspection:** GraphQL supports introspection, allowing clients to query the schema itself, making it self-documenting and aiding in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts in GraphQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GraphQL Schema:** GraphQL APIs have a schema that defines the types of data available and the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queries:** In GraphQL, clients specify the exact data they need using queries, allowing for more efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fields and Nested Structures:** Queries can include specific fields, and GraphQL supports nested structures to retrieve related data in a single request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1: Introduction:** Understand the REST API Query. You can use the playground for this : https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/?query=%7B%0A%20%20allFilms%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20edges%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20node%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20id%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20title%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%20%20%7D%0A%20%20%7D%0A%7D\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 2: Retrieve Films with Character Information:** Retrieve Films with Character Information in a single query.\n",
